## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

following things are yet to be done

<!-- - Add/Remove products from the cart -->
<!-- - Edit product quantities in the cart -->
<!-- - Fill in all fields in the checkout -->
<!-- - Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout -->
<!-- - See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart -->
  <!-- - Shipping always adds $50 to the order -->
  <!-- - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping -->
<!-- - See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary -->
<!-- - **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app) -->
